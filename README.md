# Guided Inquiry - React 

These are the challenge for this week Guided Inquiry.

In the terminal, run npm start - to begin the application. 

The code for Very Easy, Easy, and Medium can be found in basicinfo.js.
The code for Hard can be found in names.js.
Both components can be found in App.js.

Feel free to look around. Enjoy!

Exercises/ Challenge
The exercises below are to be done during and following your viewing of the resources.  Please push your completed project to a repository on Github.  Provide the link to your repo.

Note:  Solutions should use class components. 
VERY EASY: Inside of your ‘App’ class ‘render’ method, return a div with your basic information for example name, number, date of birth and etc. This div should be hard-coded to prepare for the Medium Challenge.


EASY: Create a ‘constructor’ that takes in ‘props’ , call the ‘super()’ method, and set ‘this.state’ to an empty object inside of the ‘App’ class. Inside of ‘this.state’ create a ‘person’ property and set it to an empty object


MEDIUM: Replace all of the hard-coded with data from ‘this.state.person’ in the constructor.  Then take the returned ‘div’ and create a component, pass state into it and import it as ‘BasicInfo’. (This challenge should not change the look of the page)


HARD: Now that you have a basic react app to display one person’s worth of information, now modify the app to iterate over an array of people’s basic information, while still keeping the new list of contacts in the top-level of state. (Optional: add styling to space out each person’s info)





Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
